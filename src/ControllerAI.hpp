 * - **Predictive Tracking:** It calculates the ball's future trajectory to intercept it.
 * - **Delayed Reaction:** It only updates its target periodically, not every frame, to avoid jittery, robotic movement.
 * - **Intentional Error:** It adds a slight random offset to its target position to make its hits less predictable and
 *   perfect.
