/**
 * @brief Defines a game class that orchestrates the entire game flow, acting as the central state machine.
 *
 * This class is the core of the application logic. It is responsible for:
 * - Managing the overall game state (e.g., main menu, match, win screen).
 * - Owning and managing the game scenes (`mSceneMatch` and `mSceneMenus`).
 * - Creating all game entities and placing them in the appropriate scenes.
 * - Handling and dispatching events to drive state transitions and player actions.
 * - Storing game-wide state, such as player scores.
 * - Maintaining non-owning pointers to critical entities for fast, direct access.
